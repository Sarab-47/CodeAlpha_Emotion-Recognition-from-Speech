# ðŸŽ§ Emotion Recognition from Speech using TESS Dataset

This project uses deep learning (CNN) and MFCC audio features to recognize emotions in speech based on the [TESS dataset](https://www.openslr.org/107).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Please download the TESS dataset and place it in the project root directory under the folder named `TESS/`.

## ðŸ§  Model

- Extracts MFCCs from `.wav` files
- Trains a CNN to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc.
- Can test custom `.wav` files

## ðŸ§ª Run Predictions

```bash
python predict_single.py path/to/your_audio.wav
